# Week 1 Project: Building a Calculator

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll create a calculator application and establish good development practices, including testing and CI/CD.

### Task 1: Git Repository

Create a Git repository to facilitate collaboration and version control.

### Task 2: Implement Unit Tests

Write comprehensive unit tests for the calculator functions.

### Task 3: CI/CD Workflows

Set up CI/CD workflows to ensure code quality and automatic testing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Git
- pip3
- Code editor of your choice

## Instructions

1. Fork the repository.
2. Use GitHub Codespaces for development.
3. Write unit tests for calculator functions.
4. Create a CI/CD workflow to automate testing.

## Test Your Workflow

1. Create a new branch.
2. Make a failing test.
3. Push the branch to observe CI/CD failure.
4. Fix the test, commit, and push to pass CI/CD checks.

## Next Steps

Improve code quality and explore optional enhancements, such as test coverage reports.
